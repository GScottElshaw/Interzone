# Interzone
A MacOS menu item for Transmission

A workspace where I learn to code and hopefully work with others to create a menu item that works with Transmission https://github.com/transmission/transmission.

A fan of Joy Division, and William S Burroughs, 'Interzone' seemed the perfect name for a menu item that accompanies an application called 'Transmission'.


Thus far, there is this:

And a smattering of files to begin the process. All are welcome to contribute, i just ask that you help me learn as we go.
